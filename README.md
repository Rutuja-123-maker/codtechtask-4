   - User data (such as completed modules or lessons) was dynamically displayed, providing personalized updates.

3. **Video Embedding:**
   - Incorporated video embedding features for seamless integration of educational videos into the platform.
   - Ensured the video player was responsive, allowing users to watch lessons on various devices without interruptions.

4. **Multi-Page Interface:**
   - Designed a multi-page interface that was not only visually appealing but also highly interactive.
   - The platformâ€™s design focused on creating an organized layout that guided users through the course catalog, progress page, and video lessons smoothly.
   - Emphasized an easy-to-use navigation structure, with clear calls to action, simple menus, and consistent styling across all pages.

5. **Styling & Responsiveness:**
   - Ensured the interface was fully styled to provide a professional and polished look, with attention to color schemes, typography, and spacing.
   - The design was responsive, ensuring compatibility across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

In summary, the final deliverable was a cohesive, interactive, and visually engaging multi-page interface that addressed the core needs of an e-learning platform, providing users with a smooth and enjoyable online learning experience.
